Wikipedia Title: Where to watch England vs South Africa: Live stream, TV channel, lineups, odds for 2023 Rugby World Cup semifinal
The 2019 Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa was one of many firsts: the game itself capped off a sensational tournament played outside of the sport's traditional strongholds for the first time; it was the first final in which South Africa scored a try, and by full-time, the 32-12 score in the Springboks' favour sealed a record-equalling third title for the Rainbow Nation.

Wikipedia Title: 'Biggest win of my career': De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final
The second of Sinner's Djokovic victories came in Italy's impressive Davis Cup semi-final triumph over Serbia, after saving three consecutive match points on serve, before besting the world No.1 again in the doubles. World No.4 Sinner, coached by Australia's Darren Cahill, is the first player to topple Djokovic twice in the same season since Russia's Daniil Medvedev in 2019. Italian teammates Lorenzo Sonego and Jannik Sinner will face Australia in the Davis Cup final. Credit: Getty However, if Popyrin can get the job done in the No.2 singles then Australia will, at minimum, reach the doubles with a live chance, and a good one, with 2022 Wimbledon champions Max Purcell and Matt Ebden to be unleashed. The query is whether Italian captain Filippo Volandri will turn to Lorenzo Musetti, who battled a leg issue at the end of his three-set loss to Serbia's Miomir Kecmanovic, or one of Lorenzo Sonego or Matteo Arnaldi.

Q: Does 'The Age' article suggest that Australia's Davis Cup team is aiming for an improvement in their performance compared to the previous year, while the 'Sporting News' article indicates that the South Africa national rugby team has already achieved an improvement to reach the Rugby World Cup semi-finals?

Wikipedia Title: Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president
A judge ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House.

Wikipedia Title: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer
Thousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president's 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg's calculation has consistently been below Trump's figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he's accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his "brand" adds. He also said that banks didn't rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. "They just weren't a very important element in banks' decision-making process," Trump told the court. "And we'll explain that as this trial goes along." Here's a look at New York state's valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg's own approach to assessing the assets.

Q: Which individual is implicated in both inflating the value of a Manhattan apartment to a figure not yet achieved in New York City's real estate history, according to 'Fortune', and is also accused of adjusting this apartment's valuation to compensate for a loss in another asset's worth, as reported by 'The Age'?
A: Donald Trump

But it was an IRL opportunity to meet the professionals who specialize in this kind of gimmick, the people turning online life into what one tech writer recently called a "search-optimized hellhole."
