The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \"siphons off\" news publishers' content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.

The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \"siphons off\" news publishers' content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.
