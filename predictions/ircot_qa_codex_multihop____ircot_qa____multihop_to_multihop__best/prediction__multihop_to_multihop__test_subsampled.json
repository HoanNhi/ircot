The Bloomberg article mentions that American Express is \\\"a simple, no-nonsense cash back card,\\\" but does not specify its credit rating. The Wall Street Journal article discusses American Express's strategic partnerships, but again, does not specify a credit rating. Since the question asks for an assessment that considers both aspects, and given that American Express is generally regarded as a high-quality credit issuer with strong financials and strategic alliances, the most appropriate rating would be 'A' (or higher). However, the specific letter grade is not explicitly provided in the articles. Therefore, based on typical credit ratings for a company like American Express, the best estimate is: A.
